# AVR-Template-Library
A simple library for getting started with Atmega-2560 micro-controller as well as for creating a full-fledged system around a micro-controller like Atmega-2560.

Most of the codes are written by using templates and thus the name. But 'templates' are not used just because we fancy them. Templates not only reduces the size of the code, but also makes the code faster if used properly. Of course, the suggestions and advice about whether the heavy use of template in the embedded system is good or not is always welcome. This library is just a small example of how the templates can be used to implement Policy Based Design, Singleton Design and Static Factory in the embedded system.
